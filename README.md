Answer these questions: What is your project? Why'd you build it?

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

 Summarize your goals, non-goals, and project requirements from your design doc. Make sure to link your design doc here as well.
 
 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>Replace assets with more polished objects, but drop the idea of users scanning their own objects to shoot at. Add more variety in objects. Make more use of AR space beyond placing objects on surfaces (objects fly around the camera) </strong><br/>
