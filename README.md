<h1 align="center">AR Shooter Game</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>Shoot at objects on your phone screen which interact with your environment</strong>
<br/>

<h2>About</h2>
<strong></strong><br/>
My project aimed to build a game which allowed users to spawn in objects on detected surfaces and shoot at them. I decided on this project because it combined my interests in camera work and computer science.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
<strong></strong><br/>
Build a functioning demo by the end, learn XCode IDE, Swift language, and ARKit API. 
 
 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>Replace assets with more polished objects, but drop the idea of users scanning their own objects to shoot at. Add more variety in objects. Make more use of AR space beyond placing objects on surfaces (objects fly around the camera) </strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
<strong></strong><br/>
iOS app development is difficult just in making sure everything runs on every iOS version. I really don't like XCode. 

<h2>Running your project</h2>
<strong></strong><br/>
On your phone, activate developer mode. Pull the files onto a laptop running XCode, then connect your phone to the laptop via cable. Hit run.

<h2>Misc.</h2>
XCode is insane
